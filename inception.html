                    best
                    in the dangerous art of extraction,
                    stealing valuable
                    secrets
                    from deep within the subconscious during the dream state, when the mind is at its most vulnerable.
                    Cobb's rare
                    ability has made him a coveted player in this treacherous new world of corporate espionage, but it
                    has also made
                    him an international fugitive and cost him everything he has ever loved. Now Cobb is being offered a
                    chance at
                    redemption. One last job could give him his life back but only if he can accomplish the impossible,
                    inception.
                    Instead of the perfect heist, Cobb and his team of specialists have to pull off the reverse: their
                    task is not
                    to steal an idea, but to plant one. If they succeed, it could be the perfect crime. But no amount of
                    careful
                    planning or expertise can prepare the team for the dangerous enemy that seems to predict their every
                    move.
                    An enemy that only Cobb could have seen coming.
